      <p class="hero-subline">Creative technologist, producer, and senior operator.</p>
      <p class="hero-intro">I build things that help people move, think, organize, and connect. Sometimes that means shipping large-scale digital products. Sometimes it means vibecoding an idea at 2 AM with a murderers' row of AIs. Either way, I make the complex feel simple.</p>
